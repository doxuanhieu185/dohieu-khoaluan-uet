# Graduation Thesis

The graduation thesis is titled: "Design of a Voice-Controlled Smart Switch with IoT Integration". This is an AIoT system, a combination of AI and IoT. It collects, classifies, and recognizes voice commands to control devices through the Seeed Studio Xiao nRF52840 Sense and ESP32 Devkit V1 microcontrollers. The mobile application is developed based on the React Native framework, and it can operate on both iOS and Android.

The voice recognition training model is implemented using machine learning techniques, leveraging familiar libraries such as TensorFlow. The project link can be found here: [click_here](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/334304)
